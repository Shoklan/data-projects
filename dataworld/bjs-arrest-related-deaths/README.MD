# Arrest-Related Deaths Program Redesign Study, 2015â€“16: Preliminary Findings

The Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) implemented the Arrest-Related Deaths (ARD) program in 2003 as
part of the Deaths in Custody Reporting Program to fulfill the data collection requirement of the Death in
Custody Reporting Act of 2000. The ARD program captures the number of persons who died during the process of
arrest or while in the custody of state or local law enforcement officials nationwide. This includes deaths
due to police use of lethal force or justifiable homicides, suicides, accidental deaths, and deaths from
intoxication and medical conditions that occurred during interaction with state or local law enforcement.
In 2014, BJS suspended the ARD program because of challenges that resulted in a significant underestimate of
the number of annual arrest-related deaths. That year, BJS undertook a study to examine the impact of these 
challenges and to identify ways to improve program coverage, such as relying on multiple methods to identify
arrest-related deaths.
